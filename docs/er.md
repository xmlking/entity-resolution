# Entity Resolution


What is Entity Resolution (ER)?

Entity Resolution is the task of disambiguating records that correspond to real world entities across and within datasets.

Use cases 
* Deduplication
* Record linking
* Canonicalization

Have we seen this person/business/item before?
How many distinct patients are there?
Are these similar sounding things the same thing?
What is the "Golden Record" for this entity?

From a Data Science perspective
* Complexity reduction – clustering
* Matching records – classification
* Resolving matches to entities - graph computing
