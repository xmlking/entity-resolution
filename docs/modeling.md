## Tips

- Problem with Elasticsearch is, it does not support ACID transactions. Changes to individual documents are *ACIDic*, but not changes involving multiple documents.
- use **bulk api** to update multiple types of documents in one transaction.  
- Elasticsearch provides two concepts that can help with denormalization:
  - Nested Document /Query
  - Parent & Child Relationship.
- Defines a parent/child relationship for documents in the same index.
- Use [join](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/parent-join.html) field type for **associate** and **disassociate** related docs
- As we wanted all of the properties to be searchable â€” each property was configured as `index: not_analyzed`.
- We set **docvalues** and **_all** to **false**.
